## Output:-
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f7bc601-a472-41d8-8844-2b4618309018


## Concepts:
This game showcases:
1. Custom rendering using QWidget
2. Graphics drawing with QPainter
3. Game loop using QTimer
4. Keyboard event handling
5. Basic collision detection
6. The game includes gravity mechanics, pipe generation, collision detection, score tracking, and restart functionality.


## Controls:-
Key	Action:
**SPACE** Make the bird jump
**SPACE** (after Game Over)	Restart the game.


## Game Mechanics:-
1. The bird is affected by gravity (velocity increases over time)
2. Pressing SPACE applies upward velocity
3. Pipes move continuously from right to left
4. Each pipe has a randomly generated vertical gap
5. Score increases when a pipe exits the screen
Game ends if:
->Bird hits the top or bottom boundary
->Bird collides with a pipe


## How to Build:-
1. Install Qt (Qt Creator recommended)
2. Open the .pro or CMakeLists.txt file in Qt Creator
3. Build and Run


## Future Improvements:-
1. Add sound effects
2. Add background music
3. Add difficulty levels
4. Add high score saving
5. Add animations


## Learning Outcome:-
This project was created to strengthen understanding of:
1. Event-driven programming in Qt
2. Real-time rendering
3. Object-oriented design in C++
4. Basic game physics implementation
